"""
The Top-Bottom System: an always-reversing, close-price trailing-stop
engine (spec sections 1-9).

Core model — NOT a fixed-SL/break-even/gap system:
  - BUY SYSTEM POINT = latest confirmed Top. SELL SYSTEM POINT = latest
    confirmed Bottom. A very small/latest reversal is a valid System
    Point — no minimum size, no 2/2 or wider pivot confirmation. Swing
    detection always uses left_bars=right_bars=1 (see swing_detection.py).
  - FLAT -> BUY when close crosses ABOVE the latest confirmed Top; initial
    stop = latest confirmed Bottom.
  - FLAT -> SELL when close crosses BELOW the latest confirmed Bottom;
    initial stop = latest confirmed Top.
  - While BUY, the stop TRAILS forward to the latest confirmed Bottom as
    newer ones confirm — it only ever moves up, never back down.
  - While SELL, the stop TRAILS forward to the latest confirmed Top as
    newer ones confirm — it only ever moves down, never back up.
  - FILLS HAPPEN AT THE LEVEL, not at the close that crossed it. An entry
    fills at its System Point; an exit fills at its stop level, and the
    reversal enters at that same level. This is what a resting stop/limit
    order actually does, and it is what the manual ADANIGREEN backtest
    (the source of truth this engine is validated against) records —
    every entry and exit price there is a structure level, never the
    breaching close.
  - When close crosses the trailing stop, that trade exits AT THE STOP
    LEVEL and the system immediately reverses into the opposite direction
    at that same level (the breached level becomes the new System Point) —
    there is no flat gap between trades once the first one has opened.
  - Only one position at a time; BUY->BUY and SELL->SELL are structurally
    impossible (the state machine only ever flips direction on exit).

No look-ahead: exactly as in swing_detection.py, only swings CONFIRMED by
bar i (confirmed_index <= i) are ever visible while processing bar i.
