"""
Confirmed swing Top/Bottom detection on the CLOSE-PRICE series only (never
high/low) — per the Top-Bottom System spec, section 7/8.

No look-ahead bias: a bar at index i is only a candidate pivot once
`right_bars` further closes exist beyond it, and it only ever gets emitted
at that later confirmation index — never backdated to look as if it were
known at the pivot bar itself. Both the historical backtest and any future
live-mode caller must use this exact same function so their behavior can
never diverge.
